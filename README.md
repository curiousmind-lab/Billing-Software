# Billing Software
Introducing our billing software, crafted entirely in Python for seamless and efficient transactions. This intuitive tool allows you to effortlessly manage billing processes:

Add Customer Details: Input essential customer information to personalize each transaction.

Select Items: Choose from a range of products or services to include in the bill.

Calculate Total: Simply click on the "Total" button to automatically compute the sum of selected items.

Generate Bill: Hit the "Generate" button to create a detailed bill, which will be displayed in the designated bill area.

Save Bill: The software intelligently checks the specified directory path. If the path exists, it saves the bill directly there. If not, it creates the necessary directory structure before saving the file.
